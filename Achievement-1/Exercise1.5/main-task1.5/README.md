# Object Oriented Programming in Python

## Polymorphism

In OOP, polymorphism is where a given data attribute or method has the same name across different classes or data types, but performs different operations depending on where it was defined.

## Operator Overloading

The process of defining methods to use operators on a custom class, is known as operator overloading.

## Inheritance

The properties or methods of a particular class could be useful to another class. Instead of copying code over, Python lets you inherit methods from one class to another.

### Recipe code with OOP

- Defined a recipe class
- Initialized properties and methods for each recipe
- Calculated the difficulty level for each recipe
- Added a search method to find a recipe with a specific ingredient
