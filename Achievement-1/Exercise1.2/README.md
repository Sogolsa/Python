## Create a data structure named recipe_1 that contains the following keys

- name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
- cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
- ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I have decided to choose dictionaries for this structure. Because in dictionaries you can store sets of unordered items with key-value pairs which makes it easy for a recipe to set the data and it's property. Also dictionaries are flexible for using any data type, which is good for different data types existing in a recipe like, name as string, cooking_time as integer, and ingredients as a list. And finally dictionaries are mutable so it's easy to update the recipes if needed.

## Create an outer structure called all_recipes

I chose list for the outer structure of all_recipes, because lists are sequential, can store multiple recipes and they are mutable, so I can easily add and remove recipes to it.

## Next Steps:

- Added more recipes to all_recipes list
- Printed the ingredients of each recipe as 5 different lists.
